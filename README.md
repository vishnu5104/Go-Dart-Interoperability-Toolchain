## Go-Dart Interoperability using C Wrappers and FFI

This project demonstrates how to achieve interoperability between Go and Dart using C wrappers and FFI. By wrapping Go functions in C code and exporting them as C libraries, we can use the FFI (Foreign Function Interface) library in Dart to call those functions and exchange data between the two languages.
